# Isekai
A DirectX11 based Graphics Engine.

## Technological Stack
`C++ • Win32 • DirectX11 • HLSL • RenderDoc`

## Motivation
Main objective was to learn DirectX11 API and HLSL good enough to implement a [Deferred Rendering Pipeline](https://github.com/pratik-dhende/Prime-Engine-Deferred-Renderer) and [Real-Time Procedural Terrain Rendering using Ray Marching](https://github.com/pratik-dhende/Real-Time-Procedural-Terrain-Rendering-using-Ray-Marching) in a proprietary game engine for my CSCI 522 Game Engine Development at University of Southern California's course final projects.

## Features
- DirectX11 Graphics Framework
- Win32 window
- Custom model parsing
- Texturing
- 3D Model Rendering
- Transformations like scaling, rotation and translation
- Lighting
   - Diffuse
   - Ambient
   - Point
